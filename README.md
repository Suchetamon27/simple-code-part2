## 🎯 About The Project

This repository continues from **Simple Code – Part 1**, hosting various small code snippets, mini-exercises, and sample implementations in different languages or domains (e.g. algorithms, utilities, UI, etc.).  
It’s meant to act as a sandbox for learners to explore, study, and contribute.

---

## ✨ Features / Included Examples

Some example code files included in this part:

- Algorithm implementations (sorting, searching, recursion, etc.)  
- Utility functions (string manipulation, date helpers)  
- Simple projects (todo list, simple UI demos)  
- Practice problems with input/output scripts  

You can add more examples or explore the existing ones.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack / Languages

This repo may include examples in:

- JavaScript / Node.js  
- Python  
- HTML / CSS / JS  
- Others (C, Java, etc.)  

(Adjust this section depending on what languages you have in your repo.)

---

## 🧰 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (if JavaScript examples)  
- Python (if Python examples)  
- A code editor (VS Code, Sublime, etc.)  

### Installation / Setup

This is mostly a static collection of code files, so typically you don’t “install” it — just clone and open.

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/harshpareshbhaigosalya/simple-code-part2.git
cd simple-code-part2
````

If certain examples have dependencies (e.g. Node modules), navigate into their folder and install:

```bash
cd example-folder
npm install
```

### Running / Testing

Run code files as appropriate, e.g.:

```bash
# For JavaScript file
node example.js

# For Python
python3 script.py
```

Some web-based examples might be opened via browser or served with a simple server:

```bash
# Using Python's SimpleHTTPServer (if files are HTML/JS)
python3 -m http.server
```

## 🚀 Usage

Browse through the folder structure and pick an example you want to run or study. Each folder or file will be self-explanatory.
Feel free to copy, tweak, improve, or add your own examples!
